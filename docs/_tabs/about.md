Hello, I am a Polish programmer raised in Ireland with a passion for making games. On this website you can see some of my personal projects that I've developed over the years.

I have been using the Unity3D game engine since my early teenage years. I first encountered it at Kilkenny's ['CoderDojo'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoderDojo) club in 2014 and taught myself how to make games. I became familiar with Unity and fluent in C#, enjoying game development as a hobby to entertain myself and my friends.

In 2020 I pursued my interest in programming and moved to the Netherlands to begin my BSc Computing Science at [Rijksuniversiteit Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), which I am near completing.

During my studies I loved helping classmates learn and understand concepts, which evolved into a small side-income by tutoring students for courses involving C, Java and R.
