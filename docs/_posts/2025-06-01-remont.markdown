Nowa Huta Remont was an intended sequel to [NHS]({% post_url 2025-05-25-nhs %}) developed during late 2021/early 2022.
Despite the project being discontinued, it proved to be a valuable testing ground for highly technical mechanics.
The most prominent of these is the fully destructible environment, optimised for both client-side performance and multiplayer bandwidth and stability.

## Features
- **Destructible buildings**
  - Walls fracture when damaged, using Voronoi diagrams and connectivity graphs. All fragments belonging to the same building are connected in one graph, and break off once they can not reach a 'root' node.
  - Windows can be shattered by punching, shooting, or throwing physics objects like grenades through them.
  - Furniture placed in a building is automatically connected to the Voronoi fragment below it.
  - A fractured wall's collision is made up of many convex colliders, while its renderer uses a single combined mesh. This is because physics prefers many simple meshes while rendering prefers one complex mesh.
  - Fragments are synchronised to other players. They combine client-side physics with networked position updates to achieve smooth movement that maintains consistency between clients.
  - Connectivity graphs are synchronised so that continuity is preserved even if the host disconnects and a different client must take over.
- **Deformable terrain**
  - Craters form in the ground if a powerful explosion occurs.
  - Trees are uprooted, grass is removed and the ground becomes charred.
  - Past deformation events are stored and sent to any newly-joining players so their terrain is correctly modified.
- **Optimised vegetation**
  - Trees are combined into cells. If a cell is close to the player, its trees are rendered using mesh instancing. If it is far, billboards are instanced instead.
  - Tree billboards automatically generated from mesh.
  - Only trees near rigidbodies have their colliders enabled.
  - Tree positions are stored in a quadtree, allowing for quick retrieval of the nearest tree (used during collisions to uproot the impacted tree) or of all trees in some radius (used during explosions).
  - This allows for tens of thousands of trees in a scene at once.
- **Optimised networking**
  - Lower-precision data types are used to synchronise less important features (like position of fragments) while higher-precision types are used for important features like player position.
- **Optimised bullet physics**
  - Rather than multiple sub-tick raycasts like in NHS, bullets now use only one pair of raycasts (for front-faces and back-faces) per tick.
  - Each front-face hit tells the bullet it entered a wall, and each back-face hit tells it it exited a wall. Penetration loss is calculated based on the distance between consecutive front- and back-face hits, scaled by material density.
